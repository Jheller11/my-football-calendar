# My Soccer Calendar

## Description

    This application will allow users to track all of their favorite teams and view a schedule with all upcoming games listed as well as past results.

## Phase 1

    * A user should be able to select a single team and retrieve the schedule for that team with future games and past results.
    * A user should be able to select multiple teams and view the same.
    * A user should be able to see league standings.

## Phase 2

    * A user should be able to create an account which saves their favorite teams.  This list will be used to populate a calendar on sign in.

## Phase 3

    * A user should be able to view match stats by clicking on a particular match.
    * A user can schedule reminders to be sent via the app when games are starting.
